# obamenu - menu generator for the openbox window manager

#### Description from manpage
```
	"obamenu (openbox automenu) is a menu generator for the openbox window manager. Rather than striving for full and complete xdg compliance obamenu offers a reasonable basic level of xdg compliance and focuses on low resource usage and pragmatic issues.
	obamenu consists of a single python file without any exotic imports. It has been developed with Python 2.7 should, however, work fine with any Python > 2.5 (possibly even older) and with Python's standard included batteries."
